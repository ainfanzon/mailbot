# Simple Mailbot

This is a simple script to send out an automatic pre-defined email message to a one or more email addresses. The Simple Mailbot was created to read and export from Salesforce.com report. It sends out a pre-defined message stored in a text file.

The file can be in HTML format or plain text. Key values from the Salesforce report are substituted for variables inside the message.
